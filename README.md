## :computer: **Getting Started**
Start Harnessing the power of Machine Learning to predict your future sales. 

Clone this repository to your machine & upload the notebook files to *Google Colab* or run in a *Jupyter Notebook* environment.

## :package: **Installation**

The Project uses the power of several python libraries, which can be installed using pip command:

- csv
- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- tensorflow
- keras
- matplotlib
 sklearn.linear_model
- sklearn.model_selection

## :rocket: **Usage**

Begin with running `Sales_Predictor.ipynb` in your preferred notebook environment.

## :tada: **Key Features**

Sales Predictor enfolds several powerful features:

- Extensive data analysis
- Crisp visualisations
- Heatmaps for better understanding of data correlations
- Implementation of deep learning with *Tensorflow* and *Keras*
- Comprehensive performance evaluation metrics

## :books: **Libraries Used**

Sales Predictor extensively uses several Python Libraries like CSV, Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib and Sklearn beside TensorFlow and Keras for accurate predictions.

## :page_facing_up: **Data Handling**

The project primarily uses CSV-formatted datasets. Comprehensive pre-processing is performed, addressing potential null values in datasets along with beautiful heatmap representations to visualize correlations.
